      'A true open-plan loft in a repurposed factory building with beautiful sunlight, a king bed and comfy double futon, fully stocked kitchen with dishwasher, washer and dryer, custom cedar sauna, bathroom with tub and shower, and lots of lounging spaces. The apartment is an open-plan 1500 sq. ft. loft (140 sq m) with 5 large windows providing bright sunlight all day, located in an old factory building with many of the original finishes including tin ceilings, wooden beams and columns, and white brick walls. Very few of these original factory loft buildings remain in the neighborhood, and this space is quite special. Located in the very center of Williamsburg: just two blocks from the Bedford L train and two blocks from McCarren park! Stellar restaurants, bars, nightlife, and shopping are all steps away. Manhattan is just a 5-10 minute ride on the L train.',
